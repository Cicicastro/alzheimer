__Alzheimer's Disease Dashboard__

__Overview__

This project aims to analyze patterns in MRI data from individuals with and without Alzheimer's disease. The goal is to identify key factors related to dementia progression and create an interactive dashboard to visualize insights.

__Objectives__

- Explore how age, education level, and socioeconomic status relate to dementia risk;
- Compare brain volume differences between healthy and Alzheimer's patients;
- Understand the impact of cognitive scores (MMSE & CDR) in differentiating dementia stages;
- Track the progression of Alzheimer's over time using longitudinal data;
- Develop predictive models to estimate dementia progression.

__Dataset__

The analysis uses data from the OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies) project:

Cross-Sectional Dataset: A snapshot of patients assessed once.

Longitudinal Dataset: Patients tracked over multiple years.

__Variables__
1. Subject ID - Subject Identification (i.e. OAS2_0001)
2. MRI ID - MRI Exam Identification (i.e. OAS2_0001_MR1)
3. Group - Class (i.e. Demented, Nondemented)
4. Visit - Number of visits (i.e. 1-5)
5. MR Delay - Number of days of delay between visits (i.e. 0-2639)
6. M/F - Gender (i.e. M, F)
7. Hand - Right or Left-Handed (i.e. R)
8. Age - Age at time of image acquisition (years). (i.e. 60-98)
9. EDUC - Years of education (i.e. 6-23)
10. SES - Socioeconomic status as assessed by the Hollingshead Index of Social Position and classified into categories from 1 (highest status) to 5 (lowest status) (i.e. 1-5)
11. MMSE - Mini-Mental State Examination (i.e. 4-30)
12. CDR - Clinical Dementia Rating (i.e. 0-2)
13. eTIV - Estimated total intracranial volume (cm^3) (i.e. 1106-2004)
14. nWBV - Normalized whole brain volume: expressed as a percent of all voxels in the atlas-masked image that are labeled as gray or white matter by the automated tissue segmentation process (i.e. 0.64-0.84)
15. ASF - Atlas scaling factor (unitless). Computed scaling factor that transforms native-space brain and skull to the atlas target (i.e. the determinant of the transform matrix) (i.e. 0.88-1.59)

__Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)__

The project is divided into two main analyses:

Descriptive Analysis

- Education & Alzheimer's ‚Üí Does education level influence cognitive health?
- SES & Alzheimer's ‚Üí Does socioeconomic status affect dementia risk?
- Gender & Alzheimer's ‚Üí Are there differences between men and women?
- Brain Volume & Alzheimer's ‚Üí Do Alzheimer's patients have lower brain volume?

Predictive Analysis

- Dementia Progression Over Time ‚Üí How do MMSE & CDR scores change over time?
- Brain Volume Reduction ‚Üí Does nWBV decrease faster in Alzheimer's patients?
- Education & Progression ‚Üí Does higher education slow cognitive decline?
- Time to Conversion ‚Üí How long does it take for a non-demented patient to become demented?
- Gender Differences ‚Üí Do men and women experience dementia differently?

__Dashboard__

The Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Dashboard is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio.
